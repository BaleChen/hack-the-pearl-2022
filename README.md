# Hack the Pearl 2022 Data Modeling Track: Predicting Heart Disease, Asthma, Kidney Disease, and Skin Cancer

This is a 1st-place-winning Hackathon project completed by Ivana Li, Mark Ma, and me. We participated in the Hack the Pearl 2022 competition at NYU Shanghai. A [news report](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/news/nyu-shanghai-hosts-virtual-hackathon-during-citywide-lockdown) can be found on the school's website.

The task is built upon this kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease). It's a multi-class classification task to predict 4 kinds of diseases based on patients' personal data.

Within a 48-hour time period, we tested and tuned multiple machine learning models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP, etc. We also implemented stacking to ensemble models. Due to the large imbalance in the classfication labels, we also studied the effect of some recent oversampling and undersampling techniques like SMOTE, SMOTEENN, ADASYN, etc.
